# EGS-CSharp-Example
C# "Hello, EGS!" as simply as possible. using Epic Game Services (part of Epic Online Services)

I did the official Epic "hello world" last night and supremely dislike the large WPF+xaml just to show minimal usage of the actual EOS network code.

Here, I take the important parts of the EOS workflow  (EGS specifically)  and ported it to a basic c# console app.   Eventually I want to add a godot example too.

This is loosely based on the official Epic WPF example blog series, found here: https://dev.epicgames.com/en-US/news/introduction-to-epic-online-services-eos

## WIP
this is a work in progress.   I started this on 2024-07-27 and plan on going through the entire blog series.   Initial checkin is working EOS handshake code.
